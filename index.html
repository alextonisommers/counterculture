						<h2>EARLY HISTORY</h2>

						<P>The early history of psychedelics centers around the use of naturally occurring substances, such as plants, cacti and mushrooms. For thousands of years, psychedelic drugs have played central roles in religious ceremonies as well as having been used for medicinal purposes. According to Bryn Mawr College, Native American cultures valued the effects of psychedelic drugs as a ritualistic practice carried out during sacred ceremonies.</P>
